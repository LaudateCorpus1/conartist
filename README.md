# Conartist

Hate managing all your different config files across all your different
repositories?

> Conartist is a tool that gives you a way to manage all of your config files
> from a single source of truth. Not only will it scaffold them out, it can also
> keep them in sync, even if you modify them manually.

- ‚úã Keeping separate repos in sync.
- üì¶ Keeping monorepo packages in sync.
- üèó Scaffolding out new projects.
- üìê Works well with [`workspaces`](https://github.com/treshugart/jobsite).

## Install

```sh
npm i -D conartist
```

Conartist can be configured by any one of the following:

- `conartist` field in the `package.json`
- `.conartistrc`
- `.conartistrc.json`
- `.conartistrc.yaml`
- `.conartistrc.yml`
- `.conartistrc.js`
- `.conartist.config.js`

_If you use a `.js` file, you will be able to have finer-grained control over
your configuration. More on this later._

## CLI

```sh
$ conartist --help

  Description
    Declarative project scaffolding and synchronisation.

  Usage
    $ conartist <command> [options]

  Available Commands
    default    Run the default configuration.

  For more info, run any command with the `--help` flag
    $ conartist default --help

  Options
    -v, --version    Displays current version
    -h, --help       Displays this message

```

### Simple example

If you put the following in a `package.json`.

```json
{
  "conartist": {
    "files": {
      ".gitignore": "node_modules",
      ".nvmrc": "10.16.0",
      ".travis.yml": "language: node_js",
      "src/index.js": "module.exports = {};"
    }
  }
}
```

Now run `conartist`:

```sh
$ conartist
A .gitignore
A .nvmrc
A .travis.yml
A src/index.js
```

Resulting in the following file structure:

```
‚îú‚îÄ src
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ index.js
‚îú‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îú‚îÄ .nvmrc
‚îî‚îÄ .travis.yml
```

The key from each entry is the file path relative to the `cwd` and the value
becomes the file contents.

## Configuration

The `conartist` configuration is a config `object` or a `function` that returns
a config `object`.

_All options are optional._

A `files` object is the simpler form of configuration when you don't need to
specify any other options.

```js
module.exports = {
  files: {
    "src/index.js": "module.exports = {};"
  }
};
```

A `files` array allows you to specify more options.

```js
module.exports = {
  // The these are merged with each entry in `files` but do not
  // override them.
  fileDefaults: {
    merge: false,
    overwrite: false,
    remove: false
  },
  files: [
    {
      // The name of the file relative to the directory it is run in.
      // In the `files` object, this is the key.
      name: "src/index.js",

      // The contents of the file. In the `files` object this is the
      // value.
      data: "module.exports = {};",

      // Whether or not to attempt merging with any existing file if
      // supported by the data type.
      merge: false,

      // Whether or not to override the existing file.
      overwrite: false,

      // Whether or not the file should be removed. This superseces
      // any other option because the file is deleted.
      remove: false,

      // The data type to handle the file as. Built-in data types are
      // listed below. By default this is inferred from the file
      // extension. If a data type for the file extension cannot be
      // found, the typeof the value is used. If it still can't find
      // a data type, it coerces it to a string. To specify your own
      // data type, use a function.
      type: "js"
    }
  ]
};
```

Includes is just an array of configurations that also allow you to use
module-specifier strings for loading external configurations.

```js
module.exports = {
  // These only act as defaults for `files` in the config in which they
  // are specified and do not affect anything in `includes`.
  fileDefaults: {},
  includes: [
    [
      // This is just a standard config as specified for module.exports.
      {
        files: [
          {
            name: "src/index.js",
            data: "module.exports = {};"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  ]
};
```

As noted above, you can also specify includes using module-specifiers.

```js
module.exports = {
  includes: [
    // Loaded via node_modules.
    "some-module-config",

    // Loaded relative to the CWD.
    "./path/to/config",

    // Use this form if your config will be used as an include because
    // paths are resolved relative to where the config is run from.
    require("some-module-config"),
    require("./path/to/config")
  ]
};
```

Making `includes` just standard configurations means that an include can just be
any old configuration and they're resolved recursively down the tree. The outer
configurations are applied _after_ the inner configurations, but they do _not_
override them, allowing them to be composed.

### Built-in data types

These types correspond to the `extname` of the `name` option, or can be
explicitly specified as a `type`.

- `js` takes `data` as a `string` and formats it using `prettier`.
  - `overwrite: false` Existing file is preserved.
  - `overwrite: true` New data overwrites existing file.
- `jsx` alias for `js`.
- `json` takes `data` as JSON and stringifies it.
  - `merge: false, overwrite: false` prefers existing values.
  - `merge: false, overwrite: true` prefers new values.
  - `merge: true, overwrite: false` merges values, preferring existing values.
  - `merge: true, overwrite: true` merge values, preferring new values.
- `md` takes `data` as a string and formats it using `prettier`.
  - `overwrite: false` Existing file is preserved.
  - `overwrite: true` New data overwrites existing file.
- `mdx` alais for `md`.

## API

All exported API points are documented below.

### `async bin(opt)` - automated CLI

The `bin` function automates a lot of the boilerplate in creating a CLI tool.
It's intended to jump-start your ability for you to create a Conartist config
that can be run by simply typing `npx your-command`. This idea was borrowed from
https://www.npmjs.com/package/travis.yml.

A big bonus of doing things this way is that your consumers don't need
`conartist` to be installed and serveral commands can work in harmony even if
they depend on different versions of `conartist`.

The available options are:

- `name` the name of your CLI. Defaults to `""`.
- `description` the description of your CLI. Defaults to `""`.
- `version` the version of your CLI. Defaults to `"0.0.0"`.
- `conartist` the `conartist` configuration as normally specified in a config
  file. Defaults to `{}`.
- `options` custom CLI options. Each key is the option name and each value can
  either be a `string` and will be the description, or it allows:
  - `alias` the option alias (i.e. `-a`).
  - `default` the default value.
  - `description` the option description.
- `commands` custom CLI sub-commands. Each key is the command name and each
  value can either be a `string` and will be the description, or it allows:
  - `description` the command description.

The following example creates a `npx license-mit` command.

#### `package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "license-mit",
  "description": "Creates and maintains an MIT license in your projects.",
  "author": "Your Name <you@yourdomain.com>",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "bin": "."
}
```

#### `bin.js`

The following `bin.js` uses information from your `package.json` to define
metadata, and then specifies the `conartist` option to specify the `conartist`
configuration. You could have specified `conartist` in your `package.json`, but
we wanted the ability to use template literals, thus opted to specify it as a
JavaScript object instead.

```js
#! /usr/bin/env node

const { bin } = require("conartist");
const pkg = require("./package.json");

bin({
  ...pkg,
  conartist: {
    files: {
      LICENSE: `
        Copyright 2019 ${pkg.author}

      `
    }
  }
});
```

As seen above, the configuration is specified using an `array`. However, you
could also specify a function that gets the following options passed in:

- `cli` the arguments parsed from the CLI. This allows you to add custom options
  and use them to generate your config.
- `cmd` the sub-command that was run. Defaults to `"default"`.
- `cwd` the current working directory that the config is running in.
- `opt` the options that you originally passed in to `bin(opt)`.

You could rewrite the above like so:

```js
#! /usr/bin/env node

const { bin } = require("conartist");

bin({
  ...require("./package.json"),
  conartist: ({ opt }) => ({
    files: {
      LICENSE: `
        Copyright 2019 ${opt.author}

      `
    }
  })
});
```

#### Resulting `LICENSE`

```

#### Testing

You can now test to see if your command works by running `npx .`.

#### Built-in features

The `bin` function automates quite a bit for you.

Running in specific directories:

```sh
$ npx . path/to/new path/to/existing
A path/to/new/LICENSE
U path/to/existing/LICENSE
```

Help:

```sh
$ npx . --help

  Description
    Creates and maintains an MIT license in your projects.

  Usage
    $ mit-license <command> [options]

  Available Commands
    default    Run the default configuration.

  For more info, run any command with the `--help` flag
    $ mit-license default --help

  Options
    -v, --version    Displays current version
    -h, --help       Displays this message

```

Version:

```sh
$ npx . --version
1.0.0
```

#### Publishing and running

You can now run [`np`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np) and your command is
runnable via `npx license-mit` anywhere.

### `async sync(cfg, opt)` - programmatic config application

The `sync` function takes a configuration as `cfg`, normalizes it with `opt` and
applies it to your `cwd`.

The available options are:

- `cwd` a custom current working directory to apply the configuration to.
  Defaults to `"."`.

```js
const { sync } = require("conartist");

sync(
  {
    files: {
      ".travis.yml": "language: node_js"
    }
  },
  {
    cwd: "packages/sub-package"
  }
);
```

Just like with `bin`, if you specify a function as `cfg`, the options you pass
in are passed to it:

```js
const { sync } = require("conartist");

sync(
  ({ language }) => ({
    files: {
      ".travis.yml": "language: node_js"
    }
  }),
  {
    language: "node_js"
  }
);
```
