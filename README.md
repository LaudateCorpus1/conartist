# Conartist

Hate managing all your different config files across all your different
repositories?

> Conartist is a tool that gives you a way to manage all of your config files
> from a single source of truth. Not only will it scaffold them out, it can also
> keep them in sync, even if you modify them manually.

- ‚úã Keeping separate repos in sync.
- üì¶ Keeping monorepo packages in sync.
- üèó Scaffolding out new projects.
- üìê Works well with [`workspaces`](https://github.com/treshugart/jobsite).

## Install

```sh
npm i -D conartist
```

Conartist can be configured by any one of the following:

- `conartist` field in the `package.json`
- `.conartistrc`
- `.conartistrc.json`
- `.conartistrc.yaml`
- `.conartistrc.yml`
- `.conartistrc.js`
- `.conartist.config.js`

_If you use a `.js` file, you will be able to have finer-grained control over
your configuration. More on this later._

## Usage

If you put the following in a `package.json`.

```json
{
  "conartist": {
    ".gitignore": "*.log\nnode_modules",
    ".nvmrc": "10.9.0",
    ".travis.yml": "language: node_js"
  }
}
```

Running `$ conartist` will create the specified files relative to the `cwd`.
This is great for scaffolding out a project or keeping it in sync with what the
configuration has in it.

## API

All exported API points are documented below.

### `run(opt)` - automated CLI

The `run` function automates a lot of the boilerplate in creating a CLI tool.
It's intended to jump-start your ability for you to create a Conartist config
that can be run by simply typing `npx your-command`. This idea was borrowed from
https://www.npmjs.com/package/travis.yml.

A big bonus of doing things this way is that your consumers don't need
`conartist` to be installed and serveral commands can work in harmony even if
they depend on different versions of `conartist`.

The following example creates a `npx license-mit` command.

#### `package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "license-mit",
  "description": "Creates and maintains an MIT license in your projects.",
  "author": "Your Name <you@yourdomain.com>",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "bin": "bin"
}
```

#### `bin.js`

```js
#! /usr/bin/env node

const { run } = require("conartist");
const pkg = require("./package.json");

run({
  ...pkg,
  conartist: [
    {
      name: "LICENSE",
      data: `
        Copyright 2019 ${pkg.author}

      `
    }
  ]
});
```

#### Resulting `LICENSE`

```

#### Testing

You can now test to see if your command works by running `npx .`.

#### Built-in features

The `run` function uses [`meow`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/meow) under the
hood, so it automates quite a bit for you.

Help:

```sh
$ npx . --help

  Creates and maintains an MIT license in your projects.

  Usage
    $ license-mit

  Options
    --cwd Set the cwd.

```

Options:

- `[stdin]` A newline separated list of directories to run the config in.
- `--cwd` A comma separated list of directories to run the config in.

_Both `[stdin]` and `--cwd` are supported by default as a way to either pipe or
supply paths to `conartist`. If both are provided they are merged together and
it is run on all provided paths. If none are provided, then `.` is used._

Version:

```sh
$ npx . --version
1.0.0
```

#### Publishing and running

You can now run [`np`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np) and your command is
runnable via `npx license-mit` anywhere.

### `sync(opt, cwd)` - programmatic config application

TBD
