# Conartist

Hate managing all your different config files across all your different
repositories?

> Conartist is a tool that gives you a way to manage all of your config files
> from a single source of truth. Not only will it scaffold them out, it can also
> keep them in sync, even if you modify them manually.

- ✋ Keeping separate repos in sync.
- 📦 Keeping monorepo packages in sync.
- 🏗 Scaffolding out new projects.
- 📐 Works well with [`workspaces`](https://github.com/treshugart/jobsite).

## Install

```sh
npm i -D conartist
```

Conartist can be configured by any one of the following:

- `conartist` field in the `package.json`
- `.conartistrc`
- `.conartistrc.json`
- `.conartistrc.yaml`
- `.conartistrc.yml`
- `.conartistrc.js`
- `.conartist.config.js`

_If you use a `.js` file, you will be able to have finer-grained control over
your configuration. More on this later._

## CLI

```sh
$ conartist --help

  Declarative project scaffolding and synchronisation.

  Usage
    $ conartist

  Options
    --cwd Set the cwd.

```

### Simple example

If you put the following in a `package.json`.

```json
{
  "conartist": {
    ".gitignore": "*.log\nnode_modules",
    ".nvmrc": "10.9.0",
    ".travis.yml": "language: node_js"
  }
}
```

Running `$ conartist` will create the specified files relative to the `cwd`.
This is great for scaffolding out a project or keeping it in sync with what the
configuration has in it.

## Configuration

The `conartist` configuration can be:

- An `array` of values.
- An `object` of `name` / `data` pairs.
- A `function` that returns an array of values.

### Config as an array

Each item in the configuration array must be one of the following:

- `array` where the first item in the array is anything that is valid here, and
  the second is the argument to be passed into the item if it's a function. This
  is similar to how you'd pass options to `babel` or `eslint` plugins.
- `function` that is executed in place with no arguments.
- `string` that it attempts to `require`. You can also do this yourself to
  ensure that relative paths resolve as you intend.
- `object` that is used as-is. This is what each item in the config `array` is
  normalized to.

The `object` shape looks like the following:

```js
type Item = {
  // The contents of the file that will be written to disk. If this is a
  // function, it overrides all other options and it is responsible for
  // returning a string. The item itself is passed in, so it receives the
  // options that were originally specified.
  data: string | (Item => string),

  // Whether or not to merge previous values, if supported. Defaults to
  // `false`.
  merge: boolean,

  // The name of the file that will be written to disk. This is the file you
  // specified in your configuration prefixed with the `cwd` that this
  // configuration is being run in.
  name: string,

  // Whehter or not to overwrite previous values, if supported. Defaults to
  // `false`.
  overwrite: boolean,

  // Speicfies how the data should be transformed. If this is a function, it
  // behaves similarly to `data` but it's required to use `data` and return
  // it as a string.
  //
  // By default, `type` is inferred from the `extname` of the `name` option.
  //
  // If no type can be inferred and one is not specified, the value is
  // coerced to a string.
  type: "js" | "jsx" | "json" | "md" | "mdx" | (Item => string)
};
```

### Built-in data types

These types correspond to the `extname` of the `name` option, or can be
explicitly specified as a `type`.

- `js` takes `data` as a `string` and formats it using `prettier`.
  - `{ overwrite: false }` Existing file is preserved.
  - `{ overwrite: true }` New data overwrites existing file.
- `jsx` alias for `js`.
- `json` takes `data` as JSON and stringifies it.
  - `{ merge: false, overwrite: false }` prefers existing values.
  - `{ merge: false, overwrite: true }` prefers new values.
  - `{ merge: true, overwrite: false }` merges values, preferring existing
    values.
  - `{ merge: true, overwrite: true }` merge values, preferring new values.
- `md` takes `data` as a string and formats it using `prettier`.
  - `{ overwrite: false }` Existing file is preserved.
  - `{ overwrite: true }` New data overwrites existing file.
- `mdx` alais for `md`.

### Config as an object

If the configuration is specified as an `object`, it is normalized to an `array`
where the key becomes the `name` option and the value becomes the `data` option.

For example:

```json
{
  ".nvmrc": "10.16.0"
}
```

Would be normalized to:

```json
[
  {
    "name": ".nvmrc",
    "data": "10.16.0"
  }
]
```

### Config as a function

If you specify the configuration as a function that returns an `array`, it will
receive arguments that you can use to customize the returned `array`.

When running `conartist` from the CLI:

- `cli` is the options passed in via the CLI. The CLI allows arbitrary options
  and they will be passed in as specified by the caller.
- `cwd` is the directory that the configuration is being run in. This defaults
  to `process.cwd()` but can be specified as an array by `stdin` delimmited with
  `\n` or `--cwd` delimmited by `,`. It normalize and run the configuration for
  each cwd that is specified.
- `opt` is any other metadata passed in by the CLI runner. This can be useful
  when creating your own CLI runner with `run()`.

## API

All exported API points are documented below.

### `async run(opt)` - automated CLI

The `run` function automates a lot of the boilerplate in creating a CLI tool.
It's intended to jump-start your ability for you to create a Conartist config
that can be run by simply typing `npx your-command`. This idea was borrowed from
https://www.npmjs.com/package/travis.yml.

A big bonus of doing things this way is that your consumers don't need
`conartist` to be installed and serveral commands can work in harmony even if
they depend on different versions of `conartist`.

The available options are:

- `conartist` the `conartist` configuration as normally specified in a config
  file. Defaults to `[]`.
- `description` the description of your CLI. Defaults to `""`.
- `name` the name of your CLI. Defaults to `""`.
- `options` the CLI options to parse. Unspecified options are still available as
  they were specified by the user. Defaults to `{ cwd }`.
- `version` the version of your CLI. Defaults to `"0.0.0"`.

The following example creates a `npx license-mit` command.

#### `package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "license-mit",
  "description": "Creates and maintains an MIT license in your projects.",
  "author": "Your Name <you@yourdomain.com>",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "bin": "bin"
}
```

#### `bin.js`

The following `bin.js` uses information from your `package.json` to define
metadata, and then specifies the `conartist` option to specify the `conartist`
configuration. You could have specified `conartist` in your `package.json`, but
we wanted the ability to use template literals, thus opted to specify it as a
JavaScript object instead.

```js
#! /usr/bin/env node

const { run } = require("conartist");
const pkg = require("./package.json");

run({
  ...pkg,
  conartist: [
    {
      name: "LICENSE",
      data: `
        Copyright 2019 ${pkg.author}

      `
    }
  ]
});
```

As seen above, the configuration is specified using an `array`. However, you
could also specify a function that gets the following options passed in:

- `cli` the arguments parsed from the CLI. This allows you to add custom options
  and use them to generate your config.
- `cwd` the current working directory that the config is running in.
- `opt` the options that you originally passed in to `run(opt)`.

You could rewrite the above like so:

```js
#! /usr/bin/env node

const { run } = require("conartist");

run({
  ...require("./package.json"),
  conartist: ({ opt }) => [
    {
      name: "LICENSE",
      data: `
        Copyright 2019 ${opt.author}

      `
    }
  ]
});
```

```

#### Testing

You can now test to see if your command works by running `npx .`.

#### Built-in features

The `run` function uses [`meow`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/meow) under the
hood, so it automates quite a bit for you.

Help:

```sh
$ npx . --help

  Creates and maintains an MIT license in your projects.

  Usage
    $ license-mit

  Options
    --cwd Set the cwd.

```

Options:

- `[stdin]` A newline separated list of directories to run the config in.
- `--cwd` A comma separated list of directories to run the config in.

_Both `[stdin]` and `--cwd` are supported by default as a way to either pipe or
supply paths to `conartist`. If both are provided they are merged together and
it is run on all provided paths. If none are provided, then `.` is used._

Version:

```sh
$ npx . --version
1.0.0
```

#### Publishing and running

You can now run [`np`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np) and your command is
runnable via `npx license-mit` anywhere.

### `async sync(cfg, opt)` - programmatic config application

The `sync` function takes a configuration as `cfg`, normalizes it with `opt` and
applies it to your `cwd`.

The available options are:

- `cwd` a custom current working directory to apply the configuration to.
  Defaults to `"."`.

```js
const { sync } = require("conartist");

sync(
  [
    {
      name: ".travis.yml",
      data: "language: node_js"
    }
  ],
  {
    cwd: "packages/sub-package"
  }
);
```

Just like with `run`, if you specify a function as `cfg`, the options you pass
in are passed to it:

```js
const { sync } = require("conartist");

sync(
  ({ language }) => [
    {
      name: ".travis.yml",
      data: `language: ${language}`
    }
  ],
  {
    language: "node_js"
  }
);
```
